    <h1>CHITTAGONG</h1>
    <div class="box1">
        <h3>Understand</h3>
        <p class="lekha">Chittagong is a fairly big, spread out town, and the largest international seaport in the country. Like Dhaka, the streets are filled with masses of rickshaws, though the city puts in a little more effort to keep its streets and sidewalks clean. Foreigners will notice a distinct increase in nuisances from beggars in certain intersections: for example, New Market Circle and the central Railway Station. The majority of the beggars are from other parts of the country such as Greater Mymensingh Region and Greater Noakhali area. They have migrated due to the fact that Chittagonian people are more prone to charity relative to other parts of the country.</p>
        <p class="lekha">The busiest part of town is the area around the train station and Station Road, while things get a little more bearable as you move further north. GEC Circle is the intersection of Zakir Hossain Rd, O. R. Nizam Rd and CDA Avenue, about 3 km north of the train station, and is the center of middle to upper class life with a variety of shady restaurants and shopping.</p>

        <h3>Get in</h3>
       
        <h4>By air</h4> 
        <p class="lekha"><bold>Shah Amanat International Airport</bold> is modern and clean and serves as Chittagong's international airport besides domestic services to and from Dhaka. It is the 2nd busiest in Bangladesh. Situated in Patenga, it has international services to destinations such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Kolkata, Sharjah, Muscat, Jeddah and Kuwait.</p>
        
        <h4>By train</h4>
        <p class="lekha">The train station is on Station Road just west of Jubilee Rd. Chittagong is a terminal station on the metre gauge eastern section of the Bangladesh Railway. The headquarters of this railway are located here. Train journeys are, in general, cheaper than bus journeys.</p>
        <h4>By bus</h4>
        <p class="lekha">There are 2 spots in the city where the major <bold>private companies</bold> operate from and have offices - just to the south of GEC Circle on CDA Ave, and on Station Rd near Hotel Golden Inn. Greenline, Silkline and Shohag are the nicest and have frequent services to Dhaka</p>
